3. Create a video of the app working with all of the additional features. Make the video small enough to render here or upload to a video service witha aviawable link.

4. Choose two snapshots of code that demonstrate the algorithm(s) used to implement the additional features. Explain the code in the screenshots.

This code is some that I added to update the display. I chose this part specifically because while playing the game, I noticed the timer could be hard to read if a light colored turtle spawned on top of it. To fix this, I made it so that the score display has an outline. However, Turtle does not have a built in outline, so I instead wrote the score in black with bold text, then wrote the  score again in white with normal text. This functionally acted as an outline.

This code is the part that controls what will happen after the turtle is clicked. It changes the color, stamps the turtle, then changes it back to purple so the turtle you have to click will always be identifiable. It then decreases the size, and checks if the turtle is too small. If the turtle is too small, it is sized back up.
